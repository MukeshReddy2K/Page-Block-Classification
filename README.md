Page Block Classification
Page block classification is the process of identifying and categorizing the different sections or blocks of a web page based on their content and layout. The goal of page block classification is to extract meaningful information from web pages, such as identifying the main content of the page, the navigation menu, the sidebar and other elements.
The problem consists of classifying all the blocks of the page layout of a document that has been detected by a segmentation process. The dataset we selected has 5473 instances and 11 attributes. We need to classify blocks into 5 categories (i.e., test, horizontal line, picture, vertical line and graphic) based on all the above features.

we have worked on pre-processing of the dataset like dealing with missing values and outliers. We also explored the problem of Page Block Classification and evaluated the performance of multiple machine learning models on the task. We trained and tested several popular models such as Na√Øve, Stochastic Gradient, K-Nearest Neighbors, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machines using the Page Block Classification dataset. We also worked on creating deep learning and extreme learning models. We also conducted variable selection and bi-directional elimination to identify the most important features for the classification task. Our experimental results showed that the Random Forest model with the bi-directional elimination achieved the best classification accuracy of 99.47%, outperforming the other models on this task. Overall, our study demonstrates the usefulness of machine learning for Page Block Classification and the importance of model selection and feature engineering for achieving high accuracy. The results of this project can be applied to various practical applications such as document analysis and retrieval, text recognition, and image processing.
